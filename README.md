# Turkish-as-Main-Language

Have you ever met a Turkish person who supports Tottenham FC? Well, if youâ€™ve met one, this map might just explain why! ðŸ—ºâš½

Using publicly available [census data](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/culturalidentity/language/bulletins/languageenglandandwales/census2021#measuring-the-data), I created a map that shows the percentage of people in London who speak Turkish as their main language. To my surprise, Tottenham stands out as the area with the highest concentration of Turkish speakers in the entire city. This insight opens up a fascinating connection between the local community and their football team.

Given how much Turks love football, it's no surprise that many Turkish speakers in this area may also be passionate supporters of Tottenham Hotspur. The love for the sport transcends borders, and this map provides a unique glimpse into how cultural and community trends can shape the fanbase of major sports teams.

What makes this map so interesting is how it highlights the power of data analysis in revealing cultural insights. Whether youâ€™re a sports marketer trying to understand fan demographics, or simply someone curious about the distribution of communities in urban spaces, spatial analysis uncovers stories that would otherwise go unnoticed.

So, the next time you meet someone Turkish, ask them if they are supporting any of the English football teamsâ€”there might just be a surprising cultural connection waiting to be discovered!
